/* Hiyaa, this is where I'm going to be keeping my notes & ideas and stooof. You're more than
 * welcome to use them when it's your turn to add something. Just please make sure to remove the idea
 * from the notes here if it's already been implemented. - Emmanuel Q
 * 
 * This is no an obselete list of ideas that need to be implemented, these ideas only serve to be there for us to 
 * decide on whether we should implement them or not as well as to give us more goals for us to work towards while we're
 * working on this project.
 * 
 * Idea 1- We need maximum memes up in this game. Whenever the player reaches have a picture or a gif or something
 * of Snoop Dogg, an Obey Hat, Mtn Dew, Doritos, and Intervention sniper rifle flying across the screen, whatever you want.
 * Maybe you could even implement an array containing these different images and have Unity select one at random
 * for different milestones when the player reaches a certain amount of combos. 
 * 
 * Idea 2 - This is up to you guys, but could someone please create a main menu screen? I was almost finished when Unity
 * decided to crash on me after a single line of code caused it to implode in on itself. The script for the main menu is
 * ready to go, all that needs to be (RE)implemented is the UI with a nice scenematic view of our game. Paul if you wanted to,
 * this would be a perfect opportunity to capture the villain and the hero in a nice shot for the main menu screen. Once the 
 * UI is done I'll have a look-see and make edits. Of course neither of you have to do any of this and I can just wait for
 * my turn to come back around, whatever works. :) I already wrote the script titled 'MainMenu' it just needs to be 
 * debugged a bit. For reference, look here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT4uca2bSgc
 * 
 * Idea 3 - Implemeting new levels. I'm going to be working on these after the main menu has been implemented, of course
 * anyone else is welcome to add their own levels in. Have different types of terrain and make sure to include some water 
 * please.
 * 
 * Idea 4 - Once Paul implements the villain there'll be a lot to play with, so I'm leaving this idea blank for now.
 * 
 * Idea 5 - Making the Combo Counter totally obnoxious via different font and color. A funny idea
 * Paul and I were talking about at lunch was how we could record our voices saying "COMBO!!" and having Unity 
 * choose one of our voices for reaching a certain amount of combos. This idea can TOTALLY be synced with Idea 1.
 * 
 * Idea 6 - MLG air horns play with obnoxious MLG FaZe music for reaching a certain amount of combos for
 * a certain amount of time (like two or three seconds) This idea can be synced with Idea 5 and Idea 1.
 * 
 * That's all I got for now. Rock on team "Dat Cool Group"!:D

 * 
 * Maybe Alan Turing's soul got stuck in an infinite while loop somehow (IDK LOL):
 *
 * while (true)
 * {
 *     WREAK_HAVOC();
 * }
 * 
 * Perhaps this is why Alan Turing is trying to destroy stuff.
 * It's up to Death itself to free Turing's soul from this while loop.
 * "How does it feel, Mr. Turing, to be betrayed by your own invention?"
 *
 * "It has been decades since Alan Turing has set foot in the mortal realm."
 * 
 * This message could be used whenever Alan Turing spawns:
 * "Alan Turing has emerged from the Netherworld!"
